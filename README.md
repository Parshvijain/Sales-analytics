Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and gaining insights from sales data. It helps identify patterns and uncover relationships between various variables, serving as the foundation for any data analysis project. By cleaning, visualizing, and summarizing data, EDA informs decision-making and prepares the dataset for predictive modeling.

Through data cleaning and manipulation, customer experience was enhanced by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups. Additionally, sales were improved by recognizing the most popular product categories and best-selling products, which aided in inventory planning and demand fulfillment.
